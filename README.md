# COMPUTER GRAPHICS ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
This project tries to plot 4 algorithms :
1. Digital Differential Analyzer
2. Bresenham's line drawing algorithm
3. Bresenham's Circle Algorithm
4. Midpoint circle drawing algorithm
It is an **ongoing project**, and as of now DDA is partially functional. 

# How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser.
3. Enter the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
4. Select the desired algorithm and click **Plot Figure**.
